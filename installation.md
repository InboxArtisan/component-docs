# Installation

To use these components, create a new react.email project or add it to an existing one. You can get the setup instructions here:&#x20;

> NOTE: ⚠️ We do not recommend using the default setup instructions provided by react.email, because it's development server seems to be error-prone.

### Default setup instructions (from react.email)
